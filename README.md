# Predictive-Model-CO2Flood
Study focusing on creating predictive model for synthetic CO2 Flooding case
This study focused on creating a predictive model to accurately predict the reservoir performance for 10 years
CO2 flooding project. The model itself constructed by 25 parameters, which affecting both technically and
economically in which its value distributed in three ways, discrete real, continuous real, and using a formula and
trained in experiments using CMG-CMOST. Experiments that passed the data quality control through several
constraints then used as model training and verification data. Net Present Value (NPV) is then used as project's
economic objective for the predictive model as it represents the viability of EOR application.

This study performed as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of
Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering (Institut Teknologi Bandung)
